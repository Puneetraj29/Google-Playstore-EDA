# Problem Statement
Google PlayStore team is about to launch a new feature where in certain apps that are promising are boosted in visibility. The boost will manifest in multiple ways – higher priority in recommendations sections (“Similar apps”, “You might also like”, “New and updated games”). These will also get a boost in visibility in search results. This feature will help bring more attention to newer apps that have potential. The task is to understand what makes an app perform well - size? price? category? multiple factors together? Analyze the data and present your insights in a format consumable by business – the final output of the analysis would be presented to business as insights with supporting data/visualizations.
# Insights
1. Rating have a Left Skewed Distribution i.e Mean is smaller than Median which indicates most of the applications are performing well in the platstore with an average rating of 4.0 <br>
2. Most of the app are from 15mb to 40mb and as we know all the rating of apps are quiet well of 4-4.5 <br>
3. As the free apps were removed we get a clear picture that almost all the paid apps are performing well with a higher rating as well <br>
4. We can observe that most of the paid apps are smaller in size which makes them easier to download and less stress on devices with less RAM. <br>
5. We can see that at an average all the ratings are nearly the same (close to 4) irrespective of the content rating <br>
6. We can come to conclusion that heavier apps are expected to be one of the best, but they cannot keep up with the expectations with results into lesser ratings <br>
